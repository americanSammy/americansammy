### Hi there! I'm Samantha ðŸ’–
## I'm a Mother, Cybersecurity Engineer, Developer, and a Veteran (Go Navy!)
I am a CompTIA Security+ certified programmer, though I have many interests within IT!

 #### Interests:
  - Artifical Intelligence ðŸ¤–
  - Decentralizing the InternetðŸ˜Œ (*the irony is not lost*)
  - Ethical Hacking, Security Researching
  - Digital Forensics
  - The nostalgia of everyone using HTML and CSS on MySpace

**Fun Fact:** I have (only) seen ðŸŽº Dave Matthews Band ðŸŽ¸ live 18 times. I am going for 100 shows, but after 30 years of touring, I am not sure the band will last as long as my desire to see them perform.

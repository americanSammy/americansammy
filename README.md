### Hi there! I'm Samantha ðŸ’–
## I'm a Mother, Developer, and a Veteran

- **Languages:** C#, Javascript (I realize my commits are mostly Python, but they're from my years in uni!)
- **Frameworks:** Angular (lots of time with Angular Material)
- **Pronouns:** She/Her/Hers

 #### Interests:
  - Artifical Intelligence ðŸ¤–
  - Decentralizing the InternetðŸ˜Œ (*the irony is not lost*)
  - The nostalgia of everyone using HTML and CSS on MySpace

**Fun Fact:** I have (only) seen ðŸŽº Dave Matthews Band ðŸŽ¸ live 15 times. I am going for 100 shows, but after 30 years of touring, I am not sure the band will last as long as my desire to see them perform.

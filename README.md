- **Languages:** C#, TypeScript (I realize my commits are mostly Python, but they're from my years in uni!)
- **Frameworks:** Angular (lots of time with Angular Material), Tailwind (big sad)


 #### Interests:

  - The nostalgia of everyone using HTML and CSS on MySpace

**Fun Fact:** I have (only) seen ðŸŽº Dave Matthews Band ðŸŽ¸ live 18 times. I am going for 100 shows, but after 30 years of touring, I am not sure the band will last as long as my desire to see them perform.
